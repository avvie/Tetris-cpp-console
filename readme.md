# Console Tetris

Console text based tetris

# How to play

Z - will rotate the tetronimos
Arrow keys - to move the tetronimos around

Also dont resize the console, this project was creating a text based tetris, not a friendly UI/UX

# Why?

Well i want to keep improving in c++ and as such whenever I think of something simple, or find a simple idea that won't take ages. I will attempt it to better myself.
